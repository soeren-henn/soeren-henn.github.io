		<p><b>The Impacts of Weak State Capacity in Rural Africa.</b></p>
		<p><i>Abstract: </i>Traditional authorities, family networks, and ethnic ties play an important role in rural Africa. This paper explores how central state capacity complements or substitutes the power of these local informal institutions. Existing studies lack convincing exogenous variation to estimate the causal impact of central state capacity. Using geocoded responses to the Afrobarometer and DHS survey, I consider the distance of respondents to their district headquarters as a measure for state capacity. Comparing respondents at the border of neighboring districts, I obtain quasi-random variation in their distance to the central state, while holding other characteristics constant.</p>

		<p><b>The Political Economy of Indirect Rule: Armed Groups in Eastern Congo.</b> (with <a href="http://www.ids.ac.uk/person/gauthier-marchais">Gauthier Marchais</a> and <a href="https://raulsanchezdelasierra.com/">Raul Sanchez de la Sierra</a>)</p>
		<p><i>Abstract: </i>States often created their own administration, to collect taxes and tributes, for surveillance to avoid tax evasion and attempts to subvert their power, and to control disputes andjustice - direct rule.  Historically,  however,  a large number of states have ruled instead by delegating power to the traditional political institutions that pre-existed among the newlyconquered peoples prior to their conquest - indirect rule.  This choice had important consequences for state development:  while direct rule implies the creation of persistent administrative state capacity as documented by historians, indirect rule may create local despots and can have a detrimental effects on political institutions in the long-run (Acemoglu, Chaves, Osafo-Kwaako, and Robinson, 2014, Mamdani, 1996). A fundamental challenge with existing cross-country empirical work is that the number of recorded country level episodes of this institutional change is small, and experiences are very context-dependent, so it has proven difficult to systematically understand the sources, or impacts, of direct and indirect rule. To address this challenge, we collect a novel dis-aggregated panel data set covering the histories of 456 Chiefs in 106 villages, and 508 episodes of armed groups' village governance in eastern Congo since 1990.  We achieve three goals: first, we define and operationalize indirect and direct rule across multiple dimensions of governance; second, we explain when armed groups are more likely to develop their own administration. Third, we use implicit association tests to provide suggestive evidence of the effects of indirect rule on the legitimacy of chiefs which have worked for an armed group. We find that armed groups frequently engage in directand/or indirect rule along multiple margins. While they are more likely to rely on chiefs who are coethnic with their population, and thus better able to mobilize resources, and when the group does not share ethnic ties with the population, their reliance on direct rule increases over time as they are in power. We find negligible effects of indirect rule on chief's subsequent legitimacy in implicit association tests and survey data.</p>

		<p><b>On the mechanics of kleptocratic states: Administrators' power, protectors, and taxpayers' false confessions.</b> (with <a href="https://laurapaler.com/">Laura Paler</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wilsonprichard/">Wilson Prichard</a>, <a href="http://cyrussamii.com/">Cyrus Samii</a>, and <a href="https://raulsanchezdelasierra.com/">Raul Sanchez de la Sierra</a>)</p>
		<p><i>Abstract: </i>Powerful state administrators can  take  advantage  of  their  positions  to  extract  resources,especially when political accountability is broken.  We conjecture that administrators' power de-pends on their ability to in
ict harm using the power of office, their ability to mobilize powerfulnetworks, and on their privileged access to information. Measuring transfers to administratorsis challenging, because they often involve secrecy, and surveys often draw on recall.  To circumvent this challenge, we develop a smart phone application, and monitor 400 households of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to privately report every day the universe of payments madeduring 5 months. The DRC offers a well-suited environment, because administrators systematically use their power to extract payments from citizens at unusually high rates. We deploy three randomized  interventions  aimed  to  affect  the  balance of power  between administrators and households. First, since administrators systematically take advantage of a tax code thatis extremely confusing, we organize pro-bono weekly tax consulting to a group of households.Second, to affect the bargaining power that stems from unequal access to social networks, weextend a link from a reputed civil society organization to randomly selected citizens. The organization uses its political leverage to protect the selected citizens. Third, we organize a city-wide campaign to expose administrators known to have committed abuses in a random sample ofneighborhoods.</p>

		<p><b>The Further Rise Of The Career Politician</b><i> Under Review</i></p>
		<p><i>Abstract: </i>Political careers have changed dramatically in the last fifty years. Still, political science research has yet to fully quantify this development. Building on existing literature on career politicians, this study uses a handful of indicators introduced by King (1981), a new variable (pre-parliamentary occupations), and a original data set compiled by the author. The paperâ€™s contribution to the literature is threefold. Firstly, using the variables introduced by King, we observe that a plateau in the number of career politicians has been reached. Secondly, when looking at the occupational background of politicians, the data show a further rise in career politicians. Thirdly, this development is especially prevalent among cabinet ministers.</p>
