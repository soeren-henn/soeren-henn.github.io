		<p><b>Complements or Substitutes? How Institutional Arrangements Bind Chiefs and the State in Africa.</b> <i> Revise &amp Resubmit, American Political Science Review</i> </p>
		<p><i>Abstract: </i>How does the central state interact with local actors in providing public goods? I study the effect of state capacity on local governance in sub-Saharan Africa, which I argue depends on whether traditional village chiefs are integrated in the country’s constitution. I use distance to administrative headquarters as a measure of state capacity and estimate a regression discontinuity design around administrative boundaries. If chiefs are not integrated then the state and chiefs compete with each other, working as substitutes. That is, a stronger state undermines the power of chiefs. If traditional chiefs are integrated, then the two work as complements. A stronger state then increases the power of chiefs. I show that these relationships are crucial to understand the effect of the capacity of the state on local economic development.</p>

		<p><b>The Further Rise Of The Career Politician.</b><i> British Politics 13(4), 524–553</i></p>
		<p><i>Abstract: </i>Political careers have changed dramatically in the last fifty years. Still, political science research has yet to fully quantify this development. Building on existing literature on career politicians, this study uses a handful of indicators introduced by King (1981), a new variable (pre-parliamentary occupations), and a original data set compiled by the author. The paper’s contribution to the literature is threefold. Firstly, using the variables introduced by King, we observe that a plateau in the number of career politicians has been reached. Secondly, when looking at the occupational background of politicians, the data show a further rise in career politicians. Thirdly, this development is especially prevalent among cabinet ministers.</p>

		<p><b>The Political Economy of Indirect Rule: Armed Groups in Eastern Congo.</b> (with <a href="http://www.ids.ac.uk/person/gauthier-marchais" target="_blank">Gauthier Marchais</a> and <a href="https://raulsanchezdelasierra.com/" target="_blank">Raul Sanchez de la Sierra</a>)</p>
		<p><i>Abstract: </i>In the process of state building in new territories, rulers face important trade-offs. They can create their own administration (direct rule) or delegate power to existing political institutions (indirect rule). This choice has important consequences for long-run state building and local political development. Pre-existing empirical work relies on context-dependent country-level episodes which makes it difficult to understand the determinants and consequences of indirect rule. This paper leverages a novel panel data set covering the histories of 456 chiefs and 508 episodes of village governance by armed groups in 106 villages in  the DRC.  We find that armed groups are more likely to co-opt chiefs when chiefs have more local authority, as measured by their coethnicity. They also rely on indirect rule when the armed group lacks legitimacy among the population, as also measured by their coethnicity. The use of direct rule increases with an armed groups' tenure and the resources of the village. We use survey data and implicit association tests to estimate the effects of indirect rule. We show that indirect rule decreases legitimacy of chiefs. Armed groups, however, increase their legitimacy by delegating power to the chiefs.</p>

		<p><b>On the mechanics of kleptocratic states: Administrators' power, protectors, and taxpayers' false confessions.</b> (with <a href="https://laurapaler.com/" target="_blank">Laura Paler</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wilsonprichard/" target="_blank">Wilson Prichard</a>, <a href="http://cyrussamii.com/" target="_blank">Cyrus Samii</a>, and <a href="https://raulsanchezdelasierra.com/" target="_blank">Raul Sanchez de la Sierra</a>)</p>
		<p><i>Abstract: </i>Building a successful state requires efficient tax collection. Yet, many developing countries find themselves in a kleptocratic state equilibrium where state administrators take advantage of their positions to extract resources, citizens are reluctant to pay taxes and ultimately the state lacks resources to provide public goods and pay its agents. We provide a model of kleptocratic tax collection where the abusive power of state agents depends on their office, their connections, and superior information.  We experimentally change the balance of power between state agents and the population in two ways. First, we organize pro-bono tax consulting. Second, we connect respondents with advocacy resources. To overcome difficulties in measuring taxes and bribes, we develop a smartphone application and train 300 households and businesses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to report all payments weekly. Our results show that empowering citizens can allow them to circumvent the kleptocratic state equilibrium. The tax consulting and protection treatments empower respondents, especially unregistered firms, to engage with the tax collectors. Respondents report paying less bribes and a lengthier negotiation with state agents. Moreover, the treatment induced more interactions with state officials and increased the amount of formal taxes paid. Our findings then suggest that empowerment of citizens may be a promising avenue to move away from a kleptocratic state equilibrium.</p>

		<p><b>The Lasting Impact of Colonial Educational Policies in Nigeria: Evidence from a Policy Experiment on Missionary Activity.</b> (with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/hlarreguy/" target="_blank">Horacio Larreguy</a>)</p>
		<p><i>Abstract: </i>This paper exploits a policy experiment on missionary educational activity in colonial Nigeria to estimate the lasting impact of colonialism on human capital, and the channels that explain its persistence. Results indicate that the treatment has a positive and large long-run effect on religion conversion, educational outcomes, health provision, consumption of durable goods, housing characteristics and occupation. The lasting impact of the policy experiment is explained by the persistence in the private provision of education which, as a result of the policy, substituted for missing public provision of education. The gap between treated and non treated areas is closing over time due to the reversion of the lack of public provision of education.</p>

		<p><i>Abstract: </i>A large recent literature emphasizes the importance of weak state capacity in explaining low public service delivery. However, less is known about the incentives and ability of governments to overcome such a constraint. We develop a theoretical model highlighting how the short-term unobservability of state capacity investments constrains such investments and ultimately limits service delivery, as well as the potential of corruptible certification programs to break this bad equilibrium. We test the model's empirical predictions in the context of a Mexican federal program designed to increase municipal public service delivery by certifying state capacity and public good provision. Certification is self-assessed and corroborated by corruptible local third-party institutions. Our difference-in-differences estimates indicate that certification had no average effect on overall public service delivery by municipal governments. However, consistent with the model, certification led to lower overall service delivery in municipalities where the certifying third party was more likely to be corrupt and municipal incumbents are more likely to be corrupt.</p>

		<p><b>Missionary Competition, Education, and Long-run Political Development: Evidence from Africa</b> (with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/hlarreguy/" target="_blank">Horacio Larreguy</a> and <a href="https://cschmidtpadilla.github.io/" target="_blank">Carlos Schmidt-Padilla</a>) <i> Under Review</i></p>
		<p><i>Abstract: </i>How does historical religious competition shape long-run human capital and political development? In Africa, Catholic and Protestant missionaries competed with one another through the provision of schooling to gain adherents. We exploit plausibly exogenous variation on exposure to Catholic missionaries that generated competition between Catholic and Protestant missionaries, to assess the long-run implications of missionary competition in Africa for individual human capital development and political engagement. Specifically, restricting to the sample of modern-day villages near a Catholic diocese border circa 1920, we proxy for exposure to Catholic missionaries by the proximity to their historical diocese’s head. Our identifying assumption is that the diocese on which such a border village landed was exogenous to the village characteristics, and so was the proximity to the corresponding diocese’s head. We find that exposure to religious competition between Catholics and Protestants has long-term positive effects on Catholicism and educational outcomes. The effects on political engagement depend on the regime type where individuals reside. Only educated individuals in open anocracies — relative to those in democracies and closed anocracies — are more likely to vote and participate in local politics. These individuals are more sophisticated, as reflected by their labor market outcomes, news consumption and interest in public affairs. However, they are not more supportive of democracy or its institutions, since they appear to be disenchanted with democratic outcomes.</p> <a href="/files/Henn_Missionaries.pdf" class="btn btn-default pull-right" title="PDF">Download PDF</a>

		<p><i>Abstract: </i>We show that armed actors refrain from using  their power to arbitrarily steal from an economy if, and only if, the armed actors'  property rights over stealing from that economy are secure. By 2009, armed actors  taxed, administered, and protected various villages in Democratic Republic of the Congo. We exploit the timing of an international military operation that made it impossible for them to  tax. Then, the armed actors turned to violently expropriating the villages they previously protected. The findings suggest that the security of property rights over stealing,  hence the stealing horizon, can sustain, or destroy, state functions.</p> <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w28631" target="_blank">NBER Working Paper w28631</a>

	<p><b>Africa’s Latent Assets: or, how to be optimistic about African development.</b> (with <a href="https://voices.uchicago.edu/jamesrobinson/" target="_blank">James A. Robinson</a>)</p>
	<p><i>Abstract: </i>Despite the past centuries' economic setbacks and challenges, are there reasons for optimism about Africa's economic prospects?  We provide a conceptual framework and empirical evidence that show how the nature of African society has led to three sets of unrecognized "latent assets."  First, success in African society is talent driven and Africa has experienced high levels of perceived and actual social mobility.  A society where talented individuals rise to the top and optimism prevails is an excellent basis for entrepreneurship and innovation.  Second, Africans, like westerners who built the world's most successful effective states, are highly skeptical of authority and attuned to the abuse of power.  We argue that these attitudes can be a critical basis for building better institutions.  Third, Africa is "cosmopolitan."  Africans are the most multilingual people in the world, have high levels of religious tolerance, and are welcoming to strangers.  The experience of navigating cultural and linguistic diversity sets Africans up for success in a globalized world.</p> <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w28603" target="_blank">NBER Working Paper w28603</a> <a href="https://cepr.org/active/publications/discussion_papers/dp.php?dpno=15963" target="_blank">CEPR Working Paper</a>

		<p><b>The Legacies of Atrocities and Who Fights.</b> (with <a href="https://connordhuff.com/" target="_blank">Connor Huff</a>)</p>
		<p><i>Abstract: </i>How do the legacies of atrocities shape who fights? We argue that past atrocities shape local grievances and economic incentives. Increasing grievances make individuals more likely to rebel, and less likely to fight for the perpetrator. When organizations use material incentives to recruit, worsening economic conditions increase the incentives to fight. We study how the atrocity of the 1845&ndash;1849 Great Famine affected whether Irishmen fought for or against Britain. Leveraging data on over 150,000 Irish combatants, we show that individuals in places more severely affected by the Famine fought in the pro-British Irish Militia and the WWI British military at <i>lower</i> rates. However, they rebelled against Britain at <i>higher</i> rates. Additional quantitative evidence suggests that historical grievances shaped the choice to fight for both sides, while increasing opportunity costs only mattered when organizations paid combatants. We demonstrate how the memories of the past, and economic conditions in the present, shape who fights.</p> <a href="/files/hennhuff_famine.pdf" class="btn btn-default pull-right" title="PDF">Download PDF</a>
