		<p><b>Compete or Cooperate: How Institutional Choices Shape the Interaction Between Traditional Leaders and the State in Africa.</b></p>
		<p><i>Abstract: </i>How does the central state interact with local political actors? This paper explores how the capacity of the central state changes the power of an important local governance institution in Africa, traditional leaders. While in principle the central state and chiefs can be compliments or substitutes, I hypothesize that the state’s institutional choices with regard to chiefs determines their relationship, specifically whether the central state decides to compete or cooperate with the traditional leaders. Substitution is expected when the two compete and are institutionally separated. Complementarity is more likely when the two cooperate and are institutionally linked. Comparing respondents at the border of neighboring districts, I obtain quasi-random variation in their distance to the central state, which I validate as an adequate measure of state capacity. Comparingcountries where traditional leaders are institutionally linked to the state — measured by whether they are protected in the constitution — to countries where they are not, I find that the institutional choices does indeed determine whether or not chiefs act as substitutes or complements to the state.</p>

		<p><b>The Further Rise Of The Career Politician.</b><i> British Politics</i></p>
		<p><i>Abstract: </i>Political careers have changed dramatically in the last fifty years. Still, political science research has yet to fully quantify this development. Building on existing literature on career politicians, this study uses a handful of indicators introduced by King (1981), a new variable (pre-parliamentary occupations), and a original data set compiled by the author. The paper’s contribution to the literature is threefold. Firstly, using the variables introduced by King, we observe that a plateau in the number of career politicians has been reached. Secondly, when looking at the occupational background of politicians, the data show a further rise in career politicians. Thirdly, this development is especially prevalent among cabinet ministers.</p>

		<p><i>Abstract: </i>While a large recent literature has focused on building state capacity from scratch, less is known about the ability of federal governments to induce local governments to increase their state capacity. We examine the effects of a Mexican federal program designed to incentivize municipal governments to support sustained and inclusive municipal economic and environmental development by certifying state capacity and public goods provision across 39 indicators. Certification is self-assessed and corroborated by local corruptible institutions, and may thus create incentives for political manipulation. Our difference-in-differences estimates indicate that entry into the program quickly produced large positive effects on actual state capacity outcomes. Nevertheless, we also find evidence of political manipulation: while municipal indicators showing low initial levels of performance experienced large increases in ``green'' certifications, they also experienced the smallest increases in actual state capacity on the variables supposed that should have informed the certifications. These negative estimates are driven by municipal governments politically aligned with the state governments---which are largely responsible for the implementation of the program---and more competitive electoral races.</p>

		<p><b>The Political Economy of Indirect Rule: Armed Groups in Eastern Congo.</b> (with <a href="http://www.ids.ac.uk/person/gauthier-marchais" target="_blank">Gauthier Marchais</a> and <a href="https://raulsanchezdelasierra.com/" target="_blank">Raul Sanchez de la Sierra</a>)</p>
		<p><i>Abstract: </i>When governing foreign populations, ruler often create their own administration to raise taxes, administer justice, for intelligence purposes, and to maintain social control - direct rule. Historically, however, rulers have often delegated power to the political institutions that existed prior to their conquest, creating indirect rule. This choice had important consequences for state development: while direct rule implies the creation of a new and persistent administrative capacity as documented by historians, indirect rule may create local despots, which can have detrimental effects on political institutions in the long-run (Acemoglu et al. 2014; Mamdani. 1996). A fundamental challenge with existing cross-country empirical work is that the number of recorded country level episodes of this institutional change is small, and experiences are very context-dependent. Therefore, it has proven difficult to systematically understand the sources, or impacts, of direct and indirect rule. To address this challenge, we collect a novel dis-aggregated panel data set covering the histories of 456 Chiefs in 106 villages, and 508 episodes of armed groups' village governance in eastern Congo since 1990, thereby obtaining a large number of "regime changes." We use this data to achieve three goals. First, we define and operationalize indirect and direct rule across multiple dimensions of governance. Second, we explain <i>when</i> armed groups are more likely to develop their own administration. Third, we use survey self-reported data and implicit association tests to provide suggestive evidence of the effects of indirect rule on the legitimacy of chiefs which have worked for an armed group, and "native" institutions in general. We find that armed groups frequently engage in direct and indirect rule along multiple margins. Armed groups are more likely to co-opt pre-existing traditional chiefs when the chiefs are of the same ethnic group as the population the armed group intends to govern, and when the group is of a different ethnic group than such population. Furthermore, armed groups rely more on direct rule as their tenure in power increases.</p>

		<p><b>On the mechanics of kleptocratic states: Administrators' power, protectors, and taxpayers' false confessions.</b> (with <a href="https://laurapaler.com/" target="_blank">Laura Paler</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wilsonprichard/" target="_blank">Wilson Prichard</a>, <a href="http://cyrussamii.com/" target="_blank">Cyrus Samii</a>, and <a href="https://raulsanchezdelasierra.com/" target="_blank">Raul Sanchez de la Sierra</a>)</p>
		<p><i>Abstract: </i>Powerful state administrators can take advantage of their positions to extract resources, especially when political accountability is broken. We conjecture that administrators' power depends on their ability to inflict harm using the power of office, their ability to mobilize powerful networks, and on their privileged access to information. Measuring transfers to administrators is challenging, because they often involve secrecy, and surveys often draw on recall. To circumvent this challenge, we develop a smartphone application, and monitor 400 households in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to privately report every day the universe of payments made during 5 months. The DRC offers a well-suited environment, because administrators systematically use their power to extract payments from citizens at unusually high rates. We deploy three randomized interventions aimed to affect the balance of power between administrators and households. First, since administrators systematically take advantage of a tax code that is extremely confusing, we organize pro-bono weekly tax consulting to a group of households. Second, to affect the bargaining power that stems from unequal access to social networks, we extend a link from a reputed civil society organization to randomly selected citizens. The organization uses its political leverage to protect the selected citizens. Third, we organize a city-wide campaign to expose administrators known to have committed abuses in a random sample ofneighborhoods.</p>
