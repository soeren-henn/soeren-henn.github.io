		<p><b>Complements or Substitutes? How Institutional Arrangements Bind Chiefs and the State in Africa.</b> 2023. <i>American Political Science Review.</i> 117(3):871&ndash;890 </p>
		<p><i>Abstract: </i>How does the central state interact with local actors in providing public goods? I study the effect of state capacity on local governance in sub-Saharan Africa, which I argue depends on whether traditional village chiefs are integrated in the country’s constitution. I use distance to administrative headquarters as a measure of state capacity and estimate a regression discontinuity design around administrative boundaries. If chiefs are not integrated then the state and chiefs compete with each other, working as substitutes. That is, a stronger state undermines the power of chiefs. If traditional chiefs are integrated, then the two work as complements. A stronger state then increases the power of chiefs. I show that these relationships are crucial to understand the effect of the capacity of the state on local economic development.</p>

		<p><b>Africa’s Latent Assets.</b> (with <a href="https://voices.uchicago.edu/jamesrobinson/" target="_blank">James A. Robinson</a>) 2023. <i>Journal of African Economies, Volume 32:i9–i32.</i></p>
		<p><i>Abstract: </i>Despite the past centuries' economic setbacks and challenges, are there reasons for optimism about Africa's economic prospects?  We provide a conceptual framework and empirical evidence that show how the nature of African society has led to three sets of unrecognized "latent assets."  First, success in African society is talent driven and Africa has experienced high levels of perceived and actual social mobility.  A society where talented individuals rise to the top and optimism prevails is an excellent basis for entrepreneurship and innovation.  Second, Africans, like westerners who built the world's most successful effective states, are highly skeptical of authority and attuned to the abuse of power.  We argue that these attitudes can be a critical basis for building better institutions.  Third, Africa is "cosmopolitan."  Africans are the most multilingual people in the world, have high levels of religious tolerance, and are welcoming to strangers.  The experience of navigating cultural and linguistic diversity sets Africans up for success in a globalized world.</p>

		<p><b>Monopoly of Taxation Without a Monopoly of Violence: The Weak State's Trade-Offs From Taxation.</b> (with <a href="https://marakujakivuresearch.com/" target="_blank">Christian Mastaki Mugaruka</a>, <a href="https://miguelortizp.github.io/" target="_blank">Miguel Ortiz</a>, <a href="https://raulsanchezdelasierra.com/" target="_blank">Raul Sanchez de la Sierra</a>, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/qihangwu" target="_blank">David Qihang Wu</a>) 2023. <i> Accepted, Review of Economic Studies.</i> </p>
		<p><i>Abstract: </i>This study presents a new economic perspective on state-building based on a case study in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's hinterland. We  explore the implications for the state of considering rebels as stationary bandits.  When the state, through a military operation, made it impossible for rebels to levy taxes, it inadvertently encouraged them to plunder the assets of the very citizens they previously preferred to tax. When it negotiated with  rebels instead, this effect was absent, but negotiating compromised the state's legitimacy and prompted the emergence of new rebels.  The findings suggest that attempting to increase taxation by a weak state in the hinterland could come at the expense of safety in the medium term and of the integrity of the state in the long term.   </p> <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w28631" target="_blank">NBER Working Paper w28631</a> <a href="/files/kimiaII.pdf" class="btn btn-default pull-right" title="PDF">Download PDF</a>

		<p><b>The Further Rise Of The Career Politician.</b><i> British Politics 13(4), 524–553</i></p>
		<p><i>Abstract: </i>Political careers have changed dramatically in the last fifty years. Still, political science research has yet to fully quantify this development. Building on existing literature on career politicians, this study uses a handful of indicators introduced by King (1981), a new variable (pre-parliamentary occupations), and a original data set compiled by the author. The paper’s contribution to the literature is threefold. Firstly, using the variables introduced by King, we observe that a plateau in the number of career politicians has been reached. Secondly, when looking at the occupational background of politicians, the data show a further rise in career politicians. Thirdly, this development is especially prevalent among cabinet ministers.</p>

		<p><b>The Local Memory of Repression and Who Fights .</b> (with <a href="https://connordhuff.com/" target="_blank">Connor Huff</a>) <i> Revise &amp Resubmit, World Politics.</i></p>
		<p><i>Abstract: </i>How does the local memory of past repression affect whether individuals fight for, or rebel against, the government perpetrator? We theorize how information about past repression is transmitted across generations over time to shape long-run patterns of loyalty and rebellion toward the state. We assess this argument by studying how the legacies of the 1845<code>&#8211;</code>1849 Irish Famine affected the decisions of subsequent generations of Irishmen to fight for or against Britain. Leveraging data on over 150,000 Irish combatants, we show that individuals in places more severely affected by the Famine fought in the pro-British Irish Militia and the WW1 British military at lower rates. By contrast, they rebelled against Britain at higher rates. Additional quantitative analysis provides evidence consistent with the theoretical argument: constituencies more severely affected by the Famine voted for the pro-Irish and anti-British Sinn Fein party at higher rates. Our paper demonstrates how the local memory of past repression can play a crucial role in shaping long-run patterns of conflict participation behavior.</p> <a href="/files/hennhuff_famine.pdf" class="btn btn-default pull-right" title="PDF">Download PDF</a>

		<p><b>Expanding a Weak State: Evidence from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</b> (with <a href="https://marakujakivuresearch.com/" target="_blank">Aimable Amani Lameke</a>, <a href="https://marakujakivuresearch.com/" target="_blank">Christian Mastaki Mugaruka</a>, and <a href="http://vincent-tanutama.com/" target="_blank">Vincent Tanutama</a>)
	<p><i>Abstract: </i>How does the population react to the expansion of a weak state? We study a reform in the Democratic Republic of the Congo that extends state authority, via a population cut-off, to small towns previously governed by traditional leaders.  Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that state expansion increased citizens’ demand for the state even when such an expansion is fraught. Towns above the population cut-off are more likely to have state security personnel, higher incidents of corruption and no improvement in development outcomes. However, citizens accept the state’s authority and increasingly turn to the state when resolving disputes, make more tax payments and respond to state appeals to public good contribution in behavioural games. This increased demand for the state comes at the expense of demand for traditional authority.</p>

		<p><b>Empires and the Origins of Indirect Rule: Stationary bandits and traditional chiefs in eastern Congo.</b> (with <a href="http://www.ids.ac.uk/person/gauthier-marchais" target="_blank">Gauthier Marchais</a> and <a href="https://raulsanchezdelasierra.com/" target="_blank">Raul Sanchez de la Sierra</a>)</p>
		<p><i>Abstract: </i>In the process of state building in new territories, rulers face important trade-offs. They can create their own administration (direct rule) or delegate power to existing political institutions (indirect rule). This choice has important consequences for long-run state building and local political development. Pre-existing empirical work relies on context-dependent country-level episodes which makes it difficult to understand the determinants and consequences of indirect rule. This paper leverages a novel panel data set covering the histories of 456 chiefs and 508 episodes of village governance by armed groups in 106 villages in  the DRC.  We find that armed groups are more likely to co-opt chiefs when chiefs have more local authority, as measured by their coethnicity. They also rely on indirect rule when the armed group lacks legitimacy among the population, as also measured by their coethnicity. The use of direct rule increases with an armed groups' tenure and the resources of the village. We use survey data and implicit association tests to estimate the effects of indirect rule. We show that indirect rule decreases legitimacy of chiefs. Armed groups, however, increase their legitimacy by delegating power to the chiefs.</p>

		<p><b>On the mechanics of kleptocratic states: Administrators' power, protectors, and taxpayers' false confessions.</b> (with <a href="https://laurapaler.com/" target="_blank">Laura Paler</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/wilsonprichard/" target="_blank">Wilson Prichard</a>, <a href="http://cyrussamii.com/" target="_blank">Cyrus Samii</a>, and <a href="https://raulsanchezdelasierra.com/" target="_blank">Raul Sanchez de la Sierra</a>)</p>
		<p><i>Abstract: </i>Building a successful state requires efficient tax collection. Yet, many developing countries find themselves in a kleptocratic state equilibrium where state administrators take advantage of their positions to extract resources, citizens are reluctant to pay taxes and ultimately the state lacks resources to provide public goods and pay its agents. We provide a model of kleptocratic tax collection where the abusive power of state agents depends on their office, their connections, and superior information.  We experimentally change the balance of power between state agents and the population in two ways. First, we organize pro-bono tax consulting. Second, we connect respondents with advocacy resources. To overcome difficulties in measuring taxes and bribes, we develop a smartphone application and train 300 households and businesses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to report all payments weekly. Our results show that empowering citizens can allow them to circumvent the kleptocratic state equilibrium. The tax consulting and protection treatments empower respondents, especially unregistered firms, to engage with the tax collectors. Respondents report paying less bribes and a lengthier negotiation with state agents. Moreover, the treatment induced more interactions with state officials and increased the amount of formal taxes paid. Our findings then suggest that empowerment of citizens may be a promising avenue to move away from a kleptocratic state equilibrium.</p>

		<p><b>The Lasting Impact of Colonial Educational Policies in Nigeria: Evidence from a Policy Experiment on Missionary Activity.</b> (with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/hlarreguy/" target="_blank">Horacio Larreguy</a>)</p>
		<p><i>Abstract: </i>This paper exploits a policy experiment on missionary educational activity in colonial Nigeria to estimate the lasting impact of colonialism on human capital, and the channels that explain its persistence. Results indicate that the treatment has a positive and large long-run effect on religion conversion, educational outcomes, health provision, consumption of durable goods, housing characteristics and occupation. The lasting impact of the policy experiment is explained by the persistence in the private provision of education which, as a result of the policy, substituted for missing public provision of education. The gap between treated and non treated areas is closing over time due to the reversion of the lack of public provision of education.</p>

		<p><b>How Unobserved Investments Inhibit Public Service Delivery Improvement in Corrupt Environments.</b> (with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/hlarreguy/" target="_blank">Horacio Larreguy</a> and <a href="https://polisci.columbia.edu/content/john-marshall" target="_blank">John Marshall</a>) <i>Under Review.</i></p>
		<p><i>Abstract: </i>Poor local public service delivery is common across the Global South. We argue that the short-term unobservability of investments to improve service delivery combine with adverse selection to weaken incentives for politicians to make such investments. While audits that certify investments can mitigate this monitoring problem, the certification process's effectiveness can be undermined by corruptible politicians and certifiers. We test this argument using a Mexican program designed to certify service delivery investments, where certifications are self-assessed by municipal governments and validated by corruptible third-party institutions. Difference-in-differences estimates show that the program did not ultimately improve municipal public service delivery on average. Consistent with our model, this effect is only positive when the third party is unlikely to be corruptible and when the likelihood that the incumbent is not corruptible in producing the service is large. These findings highlight the challenges in improving service delivery and the importance of incentive-compatible monitoring.</p>

		<p><b>Missionary Competition, Education, and Long-run Political Development: Evidence from Africa.</b> (with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/hlarreguy/" target="_blank">Horacio Larreguy</a> and <a href="https://cschmidtpadilla.github.io/" target="_blank">Carlos Schmidt-Padilla</a>) <i>Under Review.</i></p>
		<p><i>Abstract: </i>In Africa, missionaries used schooling to gain adherents. We study how historical missionary activity shaped long-run education and political development by exploiting
plausibly exogenous variation in exposure to Catholic missionaries generated by their territorial administration system. Using a regression discontinuity design, we show that proximity to historical diocese headquarters led to an increased presence of Catholic missionaries, as well as long-term positive effects on Catholic identification and educational outcomes. In line with recent literature, the effects on political outcomes vary by regime type. Only individuals exposed to greater historical missionary activity in open anocracies<code>&#8212;</code>relative to those in democracies and closed anocracies<code>&#8212;</code>are more likely to participate in politics. Moreover, they are also the only ones that are more sophisticated, supportive of democratic institutions, and disenchanted with the state of democracy and incumbent in their countries.</p> <a href="/files/Henn_Missionaries.pdf" class="btn btn-default pull-right" title="PDF">Download PDF</a>
