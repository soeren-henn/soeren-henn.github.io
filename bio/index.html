		<p>Soeren is a Ph.D. student in the Political Economy &#38 Government program. His main research interests are in the political economy of development and conflict as well as public finance of developing countries, with a focus on African politics and state formation. What strategies can governments use to promote development in areas with little state presence? How do armed groups govern, tax, and provide public services? What role do they play during elections? These are some of the questions Soeren is working on.</p>
		<p>He is also interested in public and labor economics of developed countries, especially the broader topic of inequality, the role of neighborhoods and inter-generational relations.</p>
		<p>He is the co-scientific director and project manager of <a href="https://marakujakivuresearch.com/" target="_blank">Marakuja</a>, a research organization in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with whom he conducts several large scale survey experiments in the conflict-affected and fragile Eastern part of the DRC.</p>
