		<p>I am a Ph.D. student in the Political Economy &#38 Government program at Harvard University. My main research interests lie in comparative political economy, economic development and public finance. Specifically, I focus on African politics, state formation, and local institutions. How is local politicis and development affected by state failure? What strategies can governments use to promote development in areas with little state presence? How do local actors (such as chiefs or armed groups) govern, tax, and provide public services? What role do they play during elections? These are some of the questions I am working on.</p>
		<p>I am also interested in urban poverty and its interaction with the state. I am working on how poor people interact with the state and how to improve the design  of public services to fit the needs of the target population.</p>
		<p>During my fieldwork I work with <a href="https://marakujakivuresearch.com/" target="_blank">Marakuja</a>, a research organization in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with whom I conduct several large scale survey experiments in the conflict-affected and fragile Eastern part of the DRC. They are a group of talented and experienced researchers. Please contact the organization if you want to conduct research in the DRC.</p>
		<p>Before coming to graduate school I earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Politics with a secondary field in Economics from the University of Essex.</p>
