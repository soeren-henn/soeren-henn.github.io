		<p>I am a Ph.D. student in the Political Economy &#38 Government program at Harvard University. My research lies at the intersection of comparative politics and political economy. I study the politics of development with a focus on fragile state settings, informal institutions, and conflict in Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly the Great Lakes region, and Latin America. Using a range of methods, from field and natural experiments to qualitative interviews my research aims to address the overarching question of what characterizes governance in fragile states and how it might be improved.</p>
		<p>Before coming to graduate school I earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Politics with a secondary field in Economics from the University of Essex.</p>
