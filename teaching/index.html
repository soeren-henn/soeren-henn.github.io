		<h1>Teaching</h1>
		<p> During my time at Harvard University I have highly enjoyed teaching students and I am looking forward to building on this experience and designing courses in development economics, political economy, comparative politics, applied microeconomics and applied econometrics. My goal is to help students think independently, analytically, and creatively about how to solve specific problems and engage with central questions in modern society. These skills will be crucial for students to succeed in their classes and beyond, regardless of which particular career path they choose.</p>
